# S&P 500 Options Pricing Prediction Model

## Overview
This project evaluates the effectiveness of various statistical models in predicting S&P 500 option values, comparing them to the Black-Scholes (BS) model. We utilize both regression and classification techniques to forecast option prices and determine whether the BS model over- or under-predicts these values.

## Objectives
- Predict S&P 500 option values using variables from the BS model
- Compare the accuracy of different statistical models
- Assess the BS model's tendency to over- or under-predict option values

## Models Used
### Regression Models
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

### Classification Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

## Key Findings
- Random Forest demonstrated the highest performance in both regression (highest cross-validated R-squared) and classification (lowest cross-validated error rate)
- Statistical models showed promising results in predicting S&P 500 option values and BS model behavior

## Future Work
While the results are encouraging, further research and model refinement are necessary before applying these techniques to predict option values for other assets.

## Significance
This research contributes to the ongoing efforts in the financial industry to improve prediction accuracy, potentially offering competitive advantages in options pricing and risk management.
